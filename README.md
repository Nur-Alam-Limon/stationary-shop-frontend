# Stationary Project

## Project Overview
This is a React-Redux-based e-commerce application for a stationary business. The project features user authentication, product management, a shopping cart, and an admin dashboard for order and user management. The application is structured using modular components and Redux for state management.

## Features
- User Authentication (Login, Logout)
- Product Listing and Details
- Shopping Cart with Persistence
- Order Management
- Admin Dashboard for Managing Users, Products, and Orders
- Protected Routes for Users and Admins

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Redux Toolkit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with Persist
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **API Communication:** RTK Query
- **UI Components:** Reusable UI elements (buttons, cards, dialogs, tables, etc.)

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories:
- **`app/`** - Contains the Redux store setup.
- **`assets/`** - Stores static assets.
- **`components/`** - Reusable UI components and sections.
- **`features/`** - Contains Redux slices and API interactions.
- **`hooks/`** - Custom React hooks for authentication and mobile responsiveness.
- **`layouts/`** - Layout components such as the main layout.
- **`lib/`** - Utility functions.
- **`pages/`** - Contains all the application pages.
- **`routes/`** - Defines application routes.
- **`types/`** - Type definitions for the project.

## Authentication & Authorization
- Users can log in to access private routes.
- Admin users have separate routes to manage the application.
- Authentication state is persisted using Redux Persist.

## Routing Setup
The application uses React Router for navigation, with protected routes for authenticated users and admin-only routes.
- Public routes include Home, About, Products, and Login.
- Private routes include the Shopping Cart and User Dashboard.
- Admin routes include user, product, and order management.

## State Management
Redux Toolkit is used to manage application state efficiently.
- **Authentication:** Handles user login state.
- **Products:** Manages product listings and interactions.
- **Cart:** Stores user cart data with persistence.
- **Orders:** Tracks order details.
